To find my friend's broken-down red car on the infinite highway, 

I start by driving in any direction and set a time limit for the journey. 

While driving, I note landmarks for reference. 

After the set time, I turn around, retracing my path and looking for those landmarks. 

If unsuccessful, I repeat the process in the opposite direction until I locate my friend's car.
